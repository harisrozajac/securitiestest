    <h2>The Division's Mission</h2>
    <p>
      To enhance Utah's business climate by protecting Utah's investors through
      education, enforcement, and fair regulation of Utah's investment industry
      while creating opportunities for capital formation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fulfill its mission, the Utah Division of Securities administers and
      enforces the Utah Uniform Securities Act by: registering securities;
      reviewing exemptions; issuing no-action letters and interpretive opinions;
      licensing broker-dealers and their agents, investment advisers and their
      representatives, issuer agents, and certified dealers; and by providing
      investor and industry education opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Division is staffed with numerous examiners, investigators, and other
      professionals to investigate alleged violations of Utah's securities laws
      and complaints involving those licensed with the Division. Upon
      discovering a violation of the law, the Division may bring an
      administrative or civil action or refer the matter for criminal
      prosecution.
