        Individuals and companies are required to license in Utah if they do
        securities business in the state. Ensuring your securities professional
        is licensed is a critical step to protecting yourself and your
        investments. Licensees are subject to regulation by the various agencies
        and their disciplinary records are public information. However,
        verifying a license can be difficult because the individual or company
        may be licensed in different capacities and may be in one of several
        databases.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Licensing Section is available to discuss your securities
        professional, their business or investment opportunity, and any public
        information about the professional. For assistance, please contact the
        Licensing Section at (801) 530-6600.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, you may use the tools to determine if the individual or
        company is licensed.
