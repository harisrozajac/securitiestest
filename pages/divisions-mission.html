      <h2>The Division's Mission</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
      <p>
        To enhance Utah's business climate by protecting Utah's investors
        through education, enforcement, and fair regulation of Utah's investment
        industry while creating opportunities for capital formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        To fulfill its mission, the Utah Division of Securities administers and
        enforces the Utah Uniform Securities Act by: registering securities;
        reviewing exemptions; issuing no-action letters and interpretive
        opinions; licensing broker-dealers and their agents, investment advisers
        and their representatives, issuer agents, and certified dealers; and by
        providing investor and industry education opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Division is staffed with numerous examiners, investigators, and
        other professionals to investigate alleged violations of Utah's
        securities laws and complaints involving those licensed with the
        Division. Upon discovering a violation of the law, the Division may
        bring an administrative or civil action or refer the matter for criminal
        prosecution.
